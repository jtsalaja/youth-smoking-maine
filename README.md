Youth Smoking Trends in Androscoggin County
================
by Charlie, Liz, Noku

## Summary

This project explores the changing patterns of youth smoking in Androscoggin County, Maine, using data from the Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey (MIYHS). Our goal was to understand how smoking behaviors have evolved over time, identify disparities among demographic groups, and assess the potential impact of public health policies and cultural shifts, particularly around the rise of e-cigarettes.

### Background

Tobacco use among youth has long been a public health concern. While national cigarette smoking rates have declined over the past two decades, the landscape shifted dramatically with the emergence of e-cigarettes. The year 2014 marked a turning point when e-cigarette use surpassed traditional cigarette use among U.S. teens. In Maine, local organizations have worked to address youth substance use, yet disparities remain.

We analyzed survey data from 2009 to 2021 to visualize these trends and ask: Who is still smoking, and why? Our focus was on both temporal change and demographic breakdowns by age, gender, and race/ethnicity.

### Key Findings

#### Decline in Smoking Over Time
Across all age groups, the percentage of teens who reported smoking at least once in the past 30 days dropped significantly from 2009 to 2021. In 2009, over a quarter of 18-year-olds reported smoking; by 2019, this figure had fallen to around 10%. The youngest age group (14 or younger) consistently reported the lowest rates, indicating some success in early prevention efforts.

#### Gender Differences Persist
Males consistently reported higher smoking rates than females in both 2009 and 2021. For example, in 2009, 28.6% of 18+ males reported smoking compared to 23.1% of 18+ females. By 2021, both groups saw significant declines, but the gender gap remained. This suggests that targeted interventions may still be needed for male youth.

#### Racial and Ethnic Disparities
Our analysis revealed persistent disparities in smoking rates across racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic and American Indian or Alaskan Native youth reported the highest smoking rates in multiple survey years. For instance, in 2009, nearly 40% of Hispanic teens reported smoking, compared to 15% of White teens. These differences call attention to the need for culturally responsive prevention programs and improved access to health education across communities.

### Policy Context and Impact

Several important policies intersect with these trends. In 2019, Maine passed a Tobacco 21 law, raising the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21. While causation is hard to determine, the decline in youth smoking that follows this law is promising.

Equally important is the cultural shift surrounding vaping. The rise of social media marketing for e-cigarettes around 2014–2017 happened at the same time with a temporary pause, or even reversal, in smoking declines for some groups. This may suggest that while cigarette use dropped, nicotine use continued in another way.

### Limitations

While this analysis provides valuable insights, several limitations affect interpretation:

- Uneven Sample Sizes: Some racial groups, such as White youth, are overrepresented in the MIYHS dataset, while others, like Asian or American Indian or Alaskan Native youth, have far fewer responses. This limits the generalizability and accuracy of patterns observed in underrepresented groups.
  
- Missing Data: Not all demographic groups are represented consistently across survey years, leading to gaps in data tracking.

- Self-Reported Behavior: All responses are self-reported, which introduces potential bias due to underreporting or overreporting.

- No Vaping Data: This project focuses on cigarette use; however, the exclusion of e-cigarette data means it may underestimate total nicotine use in recent years.

- Broad Demographic Categories: Some groups are categorized too broadly, potentially obscuring meaningful within-group differences.

- Local Focus: Findings are specific to Androscoggin County and may not reflect statewide or national trends. Thus, our findings should not be used to generalize smoking patterns across different populations outside of the Androscoggin County.

### Future Directions

This project opens several avenues for further research. First, integrating vape-specific data could provide a more complete picture of youth nicotine use. Second, examining mental health indicators alongside substance use could shed light on the motivations behind smoking. Finally, continued  study of the data by race, gender, and socioeconomic status will be critical to addressing inequities in health outcomes. 

### Conclusion

While youth smoking in Androscoggin County has declined substantially since 2009, the story is not over. Continuous data tracking, equitable policy design, and youth-centered education are essential as we look toward a smoke-free future for all.
